With `git` `worktree` `add` a new working\ntree is associated with the repository, along with additional metadata\nthat differentiates that working tree from others in the same repository.\nThe working tree, along with this metadata, is called a \"worktree\".\nThis new worktree is called a \"linked worktree\" as opposed to the \"main\nworktree\" prepared by [git-init[1]](/docs/git-init) or [git-clone[1]](/docs/git-clone) .\nA repository has one main worktree (if it\u2019s not a bare repository) and\nzero or more linked worktrees. When you are done with a linked worktree,\nremove it with `git` `worktree` `remove` .\nSection Title: Setup and Config > DESCRIPTION\nContent:\nIn its simplest form, `git` `worktree` `add` ** automatically creates a\nnew branch whose name is the final component of ** , which is\nconvenient if you plan to work on a new topic. For instance, `git` `worktree` `add` `../hotfix` creates new branch `hotfix` and checks it out at\npath `../hotfix` . To instead work on an existing branch in a new worktree,\nuse `git` `worktree` `add` ** ** . On the other hand, if you just\nplan to make some experimental changes or do testing without disturbing\nexisting development, it is often convenient to create a *throwaway* worktree not associated with any branch. For instance, `git` `worktree` `add` `-d` ** creates a new worktree with a detached `HEAD` at the same commit as the current branch.\n ... \nSection Title: Setup and Config > COMMANDS\nContent:\n`add` ** [ ** ]\nCreate a worktree at ** and checkout ** into it. The new worktree\nis linked to the current repository, sharing everything except per-worktree\nfiles such as `HEAD` , `index` , etc. As a convenience, ** may\nbe a bare \" `-` \", which is synonymous with `@{-1}` .\nIf ** is a branch name (call it ** ) and is not found,\nand neither `-b` nor `-B` nor `--detach` are used, but there does\nexist a tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it ** )\nwith a matching name, treat as equivalent to:\n```\n$ git worktree add --track -b <branch> <path> <remote>/ <branch>\n```"
